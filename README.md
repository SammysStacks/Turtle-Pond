# Turtle-Pond
 When Covid-19 forced all undergraduate students to work from home, it became necessary to provide more up to date software for students to stay organized and on top of their courses. One problem with scheduling at Caltech is that, as a small school, class times can rapidly change as professors try to accomodate as many students (now in different time zones) as possible. Not all of these time changes are reported, resulting in conflicting information found on the class website, the registar's office, and the department's listings. In response to this confusion, I decided to code up a course picker web application that allows students to check/report errors in current class times, and maintain the most up-to-date schedules that they can follow from home.  The code for the website (Turtle-Pond.com) is written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The class information (names, times, prerequisites, term offered, etc) was compiled with python's Selenium package and is accessed from a JSON database. As of September 2020, I am the sole contributor to the code and the domain/hosting fees.
